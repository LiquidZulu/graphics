#+title: Flow

+ the justification of police is that they enforce your rights
  + because police are a monopoly they do not have to and don't enforce your rights---wherever they do they do so poorly. Therefore free market would be better
    + police do do good because they get performance reviews
      + police unions protect them, so this is null
        + DOESN'T RESPOND TO THE POINT: they need unions because people will take advantage of complaints to get police fired
    + police do good because good cops stop them from having the spillover
      + there are plenty of times where it is you and your partner against the world so that doesn't happen
  + how much money would the government have to pay you to assualt someone for going out unmasked/buying cigarettes---the police do all of these things that violate your rights with impunity
    + police do follow bad orders that they shouldn't follow---Malice flows through
      + police aren't enforcing those bad laws
        + if Malice hires tim to kill alex both tim and Malice are at fault---both the officer and the politician are at fault
      + however, there is discretion where police officers can choose not to enforce bad laws
        + Cops just admitted that he only enforces the law when he feels like it, therefore discretion bad---cops have the power /at their discretion/ to throw you in a cage. Inside every cop is a feral pig.
  + they take orders from sociopaths
  + the police have no interest or obligation to enforce the law, more interested in attacking people who are enforcing public safety: neely, garner vs shoplifters getting out in the streets in 5 mins---anarcho-tyranny
+ police are people so they can do evil
  + in one respect they are different because they have agreed to be paid by sociopaths to violate your rights
    + Mr Cops: the police who arrested people for violating lockdowns should be charged---concession: police do indeed agree to be paid to violate your rights
+ police are dangerous because they put words in people's mouths (evidence: mr cops brought up something about michael saying he doesn't want proactive police but michael never said that)
+ there is a selection bias for bad people to become cops because they can be violent with impunity
+ there are two types of people in america who think words are violence: SJWs and cops
+ "can and will be used against you" is a threat
+ police have a psychological toll taken on them so they get hardened and might take it out on you
  + get psychological help, AC doesn't have the spillover
