+ argument:
  1. agents act using imperfect revisable beliefs
  2. actions occur under real constraints and have irreversible effects

  4. agents can only act meaningfully, or can only meaningfully endorse actions guided by reasons they can rely on
  c. an action is ethically permissible for an actor/agent only if its guiding reasons remain usable under fallibility and reasonable disagreement
